# Rock-Paper-Scissors

> This game originates in Japan and is also called `Jan-ken`

Rock, Paper, Scissors (RPS) is a universally recognized hand game that originated from ancient China, 
with roots tracing back to as early as 206 BCE to 220 CE during the Han Dynasty. 
Known as "shoushiling" in Chinese, this early version of the game featured symbols representing a frog, 
a slug, and a snake rather than the familiar rock, paper, and scissors. The game gradually made its way to Japan, 
where it evolved into "Janken" or "Jan-Ken," gaining popularity and utilizing hand gestures accompanied by a chant. 
Over time, variations of the game emerged across different regions in Japan, incorporating a wider array of symbols 
such as rock, paper, scissors, frog, and well. The Western version we know today simplified the game to the three 
iconic elements of rock, paper, and scissors, making it a simple yet engaging hand game that has become a beloved 
pastime worldwide.
